  Coding conventions are guidelines and rules of thumb for how to use some particular language.
  They cover things
  like file organization, indent, naming, white spacing, structure and others.
  These conventions are used mostly to improve readability of the code, make it easier to
  maintain both for yourself (if you return to this code after a while) and for others.

  I, personally, try to follow all the conventions. The one I previously haven't used is Declaration
  order in CSS and from now on I will try to use it.
